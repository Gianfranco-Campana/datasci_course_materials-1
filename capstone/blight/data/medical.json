There are four files you will use in this project:

detroit-blight-violations.csv : Each record is a blight violation incident.
detroit-demolition-permits.tsv: Each record represents a permit for a demolition.
detroit-311.csv: Each record represents a 311 call, typically a complaint
detroit-crime.csv: Each record represents a criminial incident.

For each building, you need to extract a richer set of features from the incident data and construct a feature vector. The feature vector will include at least two columns: the building_id and the label. You will create many additional columns that the model will use to predict the label. These features may be numeric, text-derived, or otherwise computed. Feature engineering is what makes or breaks analytics projects, not the method.

The performance of your model will be highly dependent on the features you select -- you should expect to return to this step as you iterate.
